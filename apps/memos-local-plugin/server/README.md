# `server/` — HTTP + SSE surface

This module exposes the `MemoryCore` over HTTP. It's used by:

1. the **Vite viewer** (`web/`) for rendering the local dashboard;
2. the **product site** (`site/`) when installed side-by-side;
3. the **bridge** (`bridge.cts`) when hosts opt into HTTP as an
   out-of-process transport instead of JSON-RPC-over-stdio.

## Design intent

- **Zero framework**. The server uses only `node:http` + small hand-
  written helpers. That keeps the attack surface tiny and makes the
  behaviour auditable line-by-line — a property we lean on heavily for
  the loopback default + API-key gate.
- **Loopback-first**. `host` defaults to `127.0.0.1`. A multi-user
  deployment must explicitly opt into `0.0.0.0` *and* set `apiKey`.
- **Thin over core**. No business logic. Every handler calls exactly
  one `MemoryCore` method and serialises the result.

## SSE streams

### `GET /api/v1/events`

Streams every `CoreEvent` the algorithm core emits. Each message uses:

```
event: retrieval.started
id: 12345
data: {"type":"retrieval.started", …}
```

Reconnects with `Last-Event-ID` are supported by the browser's
`EventSource` API.

### `GET /api/v1/logs`

Streams every post-redaction `LogRecord`. Initial connection is
pre-populated from the `logTail` provider for instant hydration; the
stream continues live after that.

The server applies a 200 msg/sec rate-limit per connection so a noisy
channel can't saturate the socket.

### `GET /api/v1/logs/tail?n=…`

Plain JSON fallback for clients that can't hold SSE open
(server-rendered pages, curl scripts, tests).

## Auth

A running server is effectively a `MemoryCore` handle — anyone who
can talk to it can read every memory, skill, and event. Two
protections apply:

1. **Default bind = 127.0.0.1.** Only processes on the same machine
   can reach the socket.
2. **Optional `apiKey`.** When set, every `/api/*` request must carry
   `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `X-API-Key: <key>`. Missing /
   mismatched keys yield `401` (not `403` — we don't confirm whether a
   resource exists before auth passes).

## Static assets

If `staticRoot` is set, the server serves files under that directory
for any non-`/api/*` path. Directory traversal attempts are caught by
resolving the requested path against the root and ensuring
containment. `/` and `/viewer` are both rewritten to `index.html`.

If `siteRoot` is set, files under that directory are served at
`/site/*`. The viewer and site thus coexist without path collisions.

## Testing

- `tests/unit/server/http.test.ts` — REST routes + auth gating (14
  tests).
- `tests/unit/server/sse.test.ts` — SSE event + log streams (3 tests).

Both use `startHttpServer` against a stub `MemoryCore`, so the
entire HTTP stack is exercised end-to-end without touching the real
pipeline.
